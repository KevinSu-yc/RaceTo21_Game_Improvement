# Race to 21 (Draft)

### Condition fixed:

- The player who gets 21 immediately wins the game.

- The only player who doesn't bust  immediately wins the game.

- Force every player to get one card at the beginning so the problem caused by no one takes a card won't happen.


### Added features:

1. **(Level 2) At the end of a game, each player is asked if they want to keep playing**
    If a player says no, they will be removed from the game. If there's only one player left, they will be the winner.
    At the beginning of each game, the deck will be rebuilt and suffled, so does the order of the players.
2. **(Leve1 1)Bet feature**
    Now the player will be asked to be an amount of money into a pot. The winner takes all the money from the pot.
    Players who have no more cash will be removed from the game automatically.
